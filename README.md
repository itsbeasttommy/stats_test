✅ Two-sample t-test (equal variances)

✅ One-way ANOVA

✅ Chi-square test of independence

✅ Correlation analysis (Pearson)

✅ Confidence interval estimation

✅ Effect size calculations

Datasets Used:
Iris Dataset (for sepal/petal measurements by species)

Student Performance Dataset (for test scores and demographics)

Tested (Titanic) Dataset

Tools:
Python

pandas

numpy

scipy.stats

matplotlib / seaborn
